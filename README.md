I'm Tom, 17 years old, French high school students in the technological sector of industry and sustainable development. 

My passion for technology was born 8 years ago in front of linux.

Today, **I code, I code and I code over and over again ... because the code allows me to escape from the really real world!**

**I uploaded my portfolio 100% made by ME in France and not in china 😆 at this address: [tom-theret.github.io](https://tom-theret.github.io)**
