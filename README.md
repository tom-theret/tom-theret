I'm Tom, 16 years old, French high school students in the technological sector of industry and sustainable development. 

My passion for technology was born 8 years ago in front of linux.

Today, **I code, I code and I code over and over again ... because the code allows me to escape from the really real world!**

**I uploaded my portfolio 100% made by ME in France and not in china 😆 at this address: [crashsystem.dev](http://crashsystem.dev)**
